CARDELS

Project is made for tracks:
1) OPEN INNOVATION
2) BEST USE OF AuthO (sponsored by MLH)

The basic idea for the project is to make a nft based card game where players can stand a chance to win an exclusively designed entrepreneur nft .
In this current time when concepts of blockchain and nft and cryptos are booming with every passing day this is our attempt to help beginners and people enter this world in a very fun way and can generate or collect their first nft.
Also they will unlock some special perks in our game with each nft they collect!!
We will use AuthO to keep the track and progress of players so that their progress is synced every time they play.
Not only this since the nft cards are based on entrepreneurs their overall power will be synced with their current company value   so it is subject to change (p.s the value of nft cards players already won wouldn’t be subject to change )
And like mutual funds our nft card values will also be subject to market risks ;) 
We will also keep an option for players to upgrade their card level by paying some minimal fee and we would donate it all NGO’S  

**We have implemented AuthO to authenticate the users who play our game. We have used it to store the user's data securely. Using AuthO provided much required security to our website. In the future, when we give away perks to the users, AuthO will be very useful for the purpose. We will be able to secure the data of perks received by the users too.**
