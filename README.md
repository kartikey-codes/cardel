An NFT card game
Project is made for tracks:
1) OPEN INNOVATION
2) BEST USE OF AuthO (sponsored by MLH)

The basic idea for the project is to make a nft based card game where players can play and stand a chance to win an exclusively designed entrepreneur nft .
In this current time when concepts of blockchain and nft and cryptos are booming with every passing day this is our attempt to help beginners and people enter this world in a very fun way and can generate or collect their first nft.
Also they will unlock some special perks in our game with each nft they collect!!
We will use AuthO to keep the track and progress of players so that their progress is synced every time they play.
Not only this since the nft cards are based on entrepreneurs their overall power will be synced with their current world value so it is subject to change (p.s. the value of nft cards players already won wouldnâ€™t be subject to change).
Our project aims to fund NGOs which work to provide basic necessities to the underprivileged children through the profits obtained in the process.
And like mutual funds our nft card values will also be subject to market risks ;)
